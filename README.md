# Zonerama albums api
Small script to embed zonerama albums on your web page <br>
Caches the result into a cache file and invalidates after a day

# Usage
1) create a folder named `cache/` ( or change the name in source code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
2) open URL in browser ( obviously change the example.com and album ID ) and you should see some JSON
